## Introduction
The Traffic Signal Optimization System is a project aimed at tackling the issue of time waste in traffic by implementing an intelligent system that optimizes traffic signal timings. By increasing the duration of green lights on busy roads, we can minimize congestion and enhance the flow of vehicles, ultimately reducing the time commuters spend waiting at red lights. This project aims to provide a smoother traffic experience, improved efficiency, and time savings for individuals and the community as a whole.

## Features
- Intelligent traffic signal timing optimization.
- Dynamic adjustment of green light durations based on real-time traffic conditions.
- Support for multiple intersections and road networks.
- Data-driven approach using traffic data and machine learning algorithms.
- User-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring.

## Technologies Used
The Traffic Signal Optimization System utilizes the following technologies:

### Software
- **Solidworks**: Used for designing and modeling the physical structure and layout of traffic signal systems.

- **YOLOv7**: An object detection algorithm used for real-time traffic analysis and vehicle detection.

- **Arduino**: An open-source electronics platform used for controlling and interfacing with the traffic signal hardware.

- **Firebase**: A real-time database and backend-as-a-service platform used for storing and retrieving traffic data and configurations.

- **React**: A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, providing a user-friendly interface for system configuration and monitoring.

- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision library used for image processing, allowing for traffic analysis and vehicle detection.
### Hardware

- **ESP32**: A powerful microcontroller board with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, used for controlling the traffic signal lights and communicating with other components of the system.

- **Raspberry Pi 4**: A single-board computer used for running the software components of the Traffic Signal Optimization System, including the object detection algorithm, database communication, and user interface.

- **LEDs**: Light-emitting diodes are used as the actual traffic signal lights. They are connected to the ESP32 board and controlled based on the system's optimization algorithms and traffic conditions.

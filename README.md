## Introduction
The Traffic Signal Optimization System is a project aimed at tackling the issue of time waste in traffic by implementing an intelligent system that optimizes traffic signal timings. By increasing the duration of green lights on busy roads, we can minimize congestion and enhance the flow of vehicles, ultimately reducing the time commuters spend waiting at red lights. This project aims to provide a smoother traffic experience, improved efficiency, and time savings for individuals and the community as a whole.

## Features
- Intelligent traffic signal timing optimization.
- Dynamic adjustment of green light durations based on real-time traffic conditions.
- Support for multiple intersections and road networks.
- Data-driven approach using traffic data and machine learning algorithms.
- User-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python package manager)
